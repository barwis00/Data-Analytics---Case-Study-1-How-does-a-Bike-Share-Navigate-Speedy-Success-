# Data Analytics - Case Study 1 - How does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success
### **Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?** 
This case study from the Google Data Analytics professional certificate on Coursera. In this case study, I work for a fictional company named Cyclistic which is a bike sharing company. As a part of this case study, I will perform a lot of real-world tasks of a data analyst.

### **Repository**

The codebase contains two files:

1. An R file where the actual analysis and visualizations took place in R programming language (along with comments)
2. An RMarkdown file where the whole description of the case study is noted down in points. Each step in the analysis is clearly explained here. It also contains the code chunks from the above file.

### **Dataset**

I will use Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. Please find [the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data 2021 here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
